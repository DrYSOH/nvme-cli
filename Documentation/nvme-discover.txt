NAME
----
nvme-discover - Send Get Log Page request to Discovery Controller.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme discover'	[device]
		[--transport=<trtype> | -t <trtype>]
		[--traddr=<traddr>    | -a <traddr>]
		[--trsvcid=<trsvcid>  | -s <trsvcid>]
		[--hostnqn=<hostnqn>  | -q <hostnqn>]
		[--raw=<filename>     | -r <filename>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
For a given NVMe Host, send a Discovery Get Log Page request
to a Discovery Controller on the network.

The [device] parameter is OPTIONAL and will default to
/dev/nvme-fabrics if none is given.

If no parameters are given, then 'nvme discover' will attempt to 
find a /etc/nvme/discovery.conf file to use to supply the
the discover command options.  If no /etc/nvme/discovery.conf file
exists, the command will quit with an error.

BACKGROUND
----------
The NVMe-over-Fabrics specification defines the concept of a 
Discovery Controller that an NVMe Host can query on a fabric
network to discover NVMe subsystems contained in NVMe Targets
which it can connect to on the network.  The Discovery Controller
will return Discovery Log Pages that provide the NVMe Host
with specific information (such as network address and unique
subsystem NQN) the NVMe Host can use to issue an
NVMe connect command to connect itself to a storage resource
contained in that NVMe subsystem on the NVMe Target.

Note that the base NVMe specfication defines the NQN (NVMe Qualified
Name) format which an NVMe endpoint (device, subsystem, etc) must
follow to guarantee a unique name under the NVMe standard.

A Discovery Controller has it's own NQN defined in the NVMe-over-Fabrics
specification, *nqn.2014-08.org.nvmexpress.discovery*.  All Discovery
Controllers must use this NQN name. This NQN is used by default by
nvme-cli for the 'discover' command. 

OPTIONS
-------
-t <trtype>::
--transport=<trtype>::
	This field specifies the network fabric being used for
	a NVMe-over-Fabrics network.  Current string values include:
+
[]
|=================
|Value|Definition
|rdma|The network fabric is an rdma network (RoCE, iWARP, Infiniband, basic rdma, etc)
|fc  |*WIP* The network fabric is a Fibre Channel network.
|=================

-a <traddr>::
--traddr=<traddr>::
	This field specifies the network address of the Discovery Controller.

-s <trsvcid>::
--trsvcid=<trsvcid>::
	This field specifies the transport service id.  For IP addresses,
	this field is the port number. By default, the IP port number
	is 4420.
 
-q <hostnqn>::
--hostnqn=<hostnqn>::
	This field is the unique NQN of a NVMe Host. This field
	will be used by the Discovery Controller to check what NVMe
	Target resources are allocated to the NVMe Host for a connection.

-r <filename>::
--raw=<filename>::
	This field will take the output of the 'nvme discover' command
	and dump it to a raw binary file. By default 'nvme discover' will
	dump the output to stdout.

EXAMPLES
--------
* Query the Discover Controller with IP4 address 192.168.1.3 for all
resources allocated for NVMe Host name host1-rogue-nqn on the RDMA network.
Port 4420 is used by default:
+
------------
# nvme discover --transport=rdma --traddr=192.168.1.3 \
--hostnqn=host1-rogue-nqn
------------
+
* Issue a 'nvme discover' command using a /etc/nvme/discovery.conf file:
-----------
# Machine default. Note currently only works for single command:
-t rdma -a 192.168.1.4 -s 4420 -q nqn.2014-08.com.example:nvme:nvm-subsystem-sn-d78432 

At the prompt type "nvme discover".
